some dictionary and CSV practice problems:

given a word, print a dictionary with number of times each letter appears in that word. For example, banana -> {a: 3, b: 1, n: 2}
bonus follow-up: print whether two words are anagrams of each other. Hint: they are anagrams if their letter counts are the same; e.g. the letter counts for "paces" and "space" are both {a: 1, c: 1, e: 1, p: 1, s:1}

what team has won the NBA finals the greatest number of times?

which team has the largest number of distinct MVPs? (assuming the MVP is the MVP of the winning team)
